product: G3

version: V15.11.0.17(9502) and before

type: Stack Overflow
### Vulnerability Description
Tenda G3 V15.11.0.17(9502) and before were discovered to contain a stack overflow in the access_dev_host_type function.
### Vulnerability details
In function access_dev_host_type line 15„ÄÅ19, it reads in a user-provided parameter `User-Agent`, and the variable `s` is passed to the `memcpy` function without any length check, which may overflow the stack-based buffer `v6`. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution.
