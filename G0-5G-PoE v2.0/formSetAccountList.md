### Vulnerability Description
Tenda G0-5g-PoEV2.0 V16.01.1.8 were discovered to contain a stack overflow in the formSetAccountList function.
### Vulnerability details
In function formSetAccountList line 30„ÄÅ34, it reads in a user-provided parameter `password`, and the variable `String` is passed to the `SimpleEncryptToBase64` function without any length check, which may overflow the stack-based buffer `v17`. As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution.
